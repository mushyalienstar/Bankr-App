# Bankr-App
Simple demo bank transaction app where you can view your balance, transfer money between accounts, and close your account

As this was created specifically to learn JavaScript, it is not very functional and will require the user to enter a username and password.
After the user has made a username and password. They have to log in with their initials of their username in lowercase (e.g, John Doe -> jd) and their password.
The transactions and balance are also defaulted as a template.
